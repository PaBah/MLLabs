Hi team,

Today we presented at the BMO Harris Innovation Finale in Chicago. So far the feedback has been really positive.
All of the bank’s C-suite are here so it was good exposure for ForwardLane. 
It’s also interesting to learn what has worked and what doesn’t work for a bank as well as what other AI startups are doing in sales and customer experience.
Will share more feedback next week.
Best,
Nathan
